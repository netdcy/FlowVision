## Build

### Environment

Xcode 15.2+

### Libraries

 - https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit
 - https://github.com/attaswift/BTree
 - https://github.com/sindresorhus/Settings

### Steps

1. Clone the source code of the project and libraries.
2. For ffmpeg-kit, it need to be built to binary first. If you want to save time, you can directly download its pre-built binary, named like `ffmpeg-kit-full-gpl-6.0-macos-xcframework.zip` (not LTS version). Unzip it, then execute this in terminal to remove its quarantine attribute:

    ```
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./ffmpeg-kit-full-gpl-6.0-macos-xcframework
    ```
    
    (Due to the project being discontinued and copyright reasons, the prebuilt binaries have been removed. Here is a [backup](https://github.com/netdcy/ffmpeg-kit/releases/download/v6.0/ffmpeg-kit-full-gpl-6.0-macos-xcframework.zip) of original file.)

3. Organize the directory structure as shown below:

    ```
    ├── FlowVision
    │   ├── FlowVision.xcodeproj
    │   └── FlowVision
    │       └── Sources
    ├── ffmpeg-kit-build
    │   └── bundle-apple-xcframework-macos
    │       ├── ffmpegkit.xcframework
    │       └── ...
    ├── BTree
    │   ├── Package.swift
    │   └── Sources
    └── Settings
        ├── Package.swift
        └── Sources
    ```

4. Open `FlowVision.xcodeproj` by Xcode, click 'Product' -> 'Build For' -> 'Profiling' in menu bar.
5. Then 'Product' -> 'Show Build Folder in Finder', and you will find the app is at `Products/Release/FlowVision.app`.
