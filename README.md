## FAQ

**Q1: Why can't I open the application? I see a warning saying the app is not trusted.**

**A1:** This happens because the app is not notarized by Apple. Please follow the instructions provided in [Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/102445#openanyway) to open the app.

**Q2: Why isn't the application notarized?**

**A2:** Notarizing an app requires an annual $100 fee to Apple. To keep the software free, we haven't notarized it. If you prefer, you can build the app yourself from the source code.

## Build

### Environment

Xcode 15.2+

### Libraries

 - https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit
 - https://github.com/attaswift/BTree
 - https://github.com/sindresorhus/Settings

### Steps

1. Clone the source code of the project and libraries.
2. For ffmpeg-kit, it need to be built to binary first. If you want to save time, you can directly download its pre-built binary, named like `ffmpeg-kit-full-gpl-6.0-macos-xcframework.zip` (not LTS version). Unzip it, then execute this in terminal to remove its quarantine attribute:

    ```
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./ffmpeg-kit-full-gpl-6.0-macos-xcframework
    ```

3. Organize the directory structure as shown below:

    ```
    ├── FlowVision
    │   ├── FlowVision.xcodeproj
    │   └── FlowVision
    │       └── Sources
    ├── ffmpeg-kit-build
    │   └── bundle-apple-xcframework-macos
    │       ├── ffmpegkit.xcframework
    │       └── ...
    ├── BTree
    │   ├── Package.swift
    │   └── Sources
    └── Settings
        ├── Package.swift
        └── Sources
    ```

4. Open `FlowVision.xcodeproj` by Xcode, click 'Product' -> 'Build For' -> 'Profiling' in menu bar.
5. Then 'Product' -> 'Show Build Folder in Finder', and you will find the app is at `Products/Release/FlowVison.app`.
